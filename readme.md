# pinboard re-tagging project

> A project to deal with arbitrary and strange pinboard tags.

## Goals

* [ ] split xx.xx.xx bookmarks into atomic individual tags
* [ ] replace xx.xx.xx decorated tags with atomic tags
* [ ] find ios and osx (or web) pinboard apps that work well with atomic tags
* [ ] throw out trash, ancient, pointless
* [ ] legacy bookmarks - which are still live? which are still useful?
* [ ] upload legacy bookmarks
* [ ] clean up which bookmarks are shared and which are not
* [ ] make shared bookmarks site (temporary, patch before TC knowledge site)
* [ ] make nice, visual bookmark browser, or else find similar and install
* [ ] make graph view of tags -- d3 learning experience
* [ ] stop gathering so many damn tags
* [ ] can I find age of tags? and # of visits? and can I throw out unloved sites?

## WIP

* [ ] figure out pinboard API
* [ ] download bookmarks as text (gitignore)



## Done
